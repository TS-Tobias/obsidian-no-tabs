Whenever you create a new tab in Obsidian, a new tab is opened. This can get quite annoying if you want to quickly capture a large amount of notes.
Unfortunately, there is currently no way of changing this behaviour in Obsidian.
You have to close all those tabs manually either through the context menu or by using keyboard shortcuts (e.g. `CMD+W` | `CTRL+W`).

This plugin works around this limitation by closing the previously active tab whenever you create a new note. Pinned, and manually opened tabs that are not active will stay open though. This plugin also works together with split panes.
